The objective of this project is to start with a basic web application and progressively enhance it to simulate a real-world service environment. The goal is to tackle various challenges that arise as the application scales, making iterative improvements in architecture, performance, and user engagement.

### **Initial Technology Stack**
At the beginning of the project, the application will be built with the following technologies:
1. **Java 21** – Leveraging the latest features and performance enhancements.
2. **Spring Boot 3.xx** – A robust and scalable backend framework for building microservices.
3. **PostgreSQL** – A reliable and powerful relational database for structured data storage.
4. **JWT-OAuth** – Secure authentication and authorization for user management.
5. **Vite** – A modern, fast build tool for frontend development.
6. **React** – A highly flexible and efficient library for building the user interface.

### **Potential Challenges & Solutions**
As the application grows, it will face real-world scaling issues that require architectural and technological enhancements:

#### **1. A Sudden Surge in Users: Scaling Challenges**
- The platform gains massive popularity, leading to an overwhelming number of concurrent users.
- **Solution:**
    - Implement **load balancing** to distribute traffic efficiently across multiple instances.
    - Introduce an **API Gateway** to manage authentication, rate limiting, and routing.
    - Consider **horizontal scaling** with cloud-based infrastructure.

#### **2. Slow Product Search: Performance Optimization**
- As the number of products increases, the search functionality becomes sluggish.
- **Solution:**
    - Replace traditional relational queries with **NoSQL databases (MongoDB)** for flexible, high-performance data handling.
    - Integrate **Elasticsearch** for fast and scalable full-text search capabilities.
    - Utilize **Kafka** as an event-driven message broker to handle data synchronization efficiently.

#### **3. Decreasing User Engagement: Retention Strategies**
- A decline in user activity requires an effective strategy to re-engage customers.
- **Solution:**
    - Implement **dynamic coupon-based promotions** to incentivize purchases.
    - Develop **personalized event-based notifications** using behavioral analytics.
    - Introduce **gamification elements** such as loyalty points or referral bonuses.
